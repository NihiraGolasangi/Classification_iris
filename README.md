# Classification_iris


This project involves using the Iris dataset to perform classification, utilizing various machine learning algorithms. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers.

The first step in the project involved data preprocessing, including data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection. Next, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with the former used to train various machine learning models, and the latter used to evaluate the performance of the models.
